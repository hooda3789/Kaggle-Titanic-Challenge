# Kaggle-Titanic-Challenge
Converted Age, Embarked, Sex, Fare to integer and the missing values of Age is replaced by the mean value and the mean value of Embarked is replaced by most repetitive word.
As Cabin had most missing values so I have dropped it, I have also dropped Name and Ticket featres.
For the model building I have used Logistic Regression from skearn.inear_models as the outpt had only 2 classes i.e, Survived or not.
I have got Kaggle score of 0.76 on this
